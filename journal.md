## June 30th: Base Schematic and PCB
I'm speedrunning another project, I found a basic template to start off with for the ESP32-S3 Module, I dont wanna have any errors in the ESP32 part thats why I'm using a template for the MCU, now I'll decide my layout and make a schematic for that. Oh I also added some extra things like Type-C instead of Micro USB and other things. I'm doing a 4 layer board for the RF and Electrical noise stuff. I'll remove the other extra things like the sensors and RGB and I'll replace it with other things.
